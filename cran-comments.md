## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version, I have:

* Added a sentence to the DESCRIPTION detailing where to find the manuscript that I reference in multiple help files

* Replaced \dontrun{} with \donttest{} in cv_vim.R

* unwrapped examples in average_vim.R, merge_vim.R, and vimp_regression.R

* removed generateData.Rd

## Test environments
* local ubuntu 16.04, R 3.4.4
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.0
* windows server 2012 (on appveyor), R 3.5.0
* local windows 10, R 3.4.4
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs; there is one NOTE, about me (Brian D. Williamson) being a first-time maintainer.


## Downstream dependencies
None.
