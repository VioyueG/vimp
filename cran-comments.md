## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version, I have:

* Added two vignettes, "Types of VIMs" and "Using precomputed regression function
* Updated the main vignette to only use `run_regression = TRUE` for simplicity

## Test environments
* local ubuntu 18.04, R 3.6.3
* ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS (on travis-ci), R 3.6.2
* windows server 2012 (on appveyor), R 3.6.3
* R-hub windows-x86_64-devel (r-devel)
* R-hub ubuntu-gcc-release (r-release)
* R-hub fedora-clang-devel (r-devel)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs; there was one NOTE, that I (Brian D. Williamson) am the package maintainer, and that "Biometrics", "arXiv", "Feng", and "ICML" may be misspelled in the DESCRIPTION.

## Downstream dependencies
None.
