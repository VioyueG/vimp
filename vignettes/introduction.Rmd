Often when working with data we attempt to estimate the conditional mean of the outcome $Y$ given features $X$, defined as $E_P(Y \mid X)$. 

There are many tools for estimating this conditional mean. We might choose a classical parametric tool such as linear regression. We might also want to be model-agnostic and use a more nonparametric approach to estimate the conditional mean. However, 

- This involves using some nonparametric smoothing technique, which requires: (1) choosing a technique, and (2) selecting tuning parameters
- Naive optimal tuning balances out the bias and variance of the smoothing estimator. Is this the correct trade-off for estimating the conditional mean?
